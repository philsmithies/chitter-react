<!-- Overview -->

**Chitter:** A full-stack web app inspired by [Twitter.](https://www.twitter.com/) Within the app the user can sign up, add a profile photo as well as add photos to their posts. As well as update their profile with banner images and a bio. The application was built in React and Node JS, and was a help in understanding JWT's and the authentication process.
